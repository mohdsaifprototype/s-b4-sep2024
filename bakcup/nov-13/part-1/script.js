/* Operators in JS */

/* Operators are divided into two categories 
1. Unary Operators
2. Binary Operators

e.g.,

a + b       // a, and b are operands and + is operator
a + b + c   // a, b and c are operands and + is operator
*/

/* Unary Operators:
1. typeof
2. ++a
3. --a
5. +a
6. -a
*/

// let variable = "23";

// console.log("Type of variable is: ", typeof variable);

/* 
Aritmatic Operator:

1. +    addition operator           plus
2. -    subtraction operator        minus
3. *    multiplication operator     multiply
4. /    division operator           divide
5. %    modulus operator            remainder
6. **   exponentiation operator     exponent
*/

/* 
Relational Operator:

1. >    greater than
2. <    less than
3. >=   greater than or equal to
4. <=   less than or equal to
5. ==   equal to
6. ===  strict equal to
7. !=   not equal to
8. !==  strict not equal to
*/

let result;

result = 2 === "2";
console.log("Result is:", result);
